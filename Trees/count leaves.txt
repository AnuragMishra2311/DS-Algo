Given a Binary Tree of size N , You have to count leaves in it. For example, there are two leaves in following tree

        1
     /    \
   10     39
   /
  5



int countLeaves(Node* root)
{
  // Your code here
  int sum;
  if(root==NULL)
  {
      return 0;
  }
  if(root->left==NULL && root->right==NULL)
  {
      return 1;
  }
  sum=countLeaves(root->left)+countLeaves(root->right);
  return sum;
  
}
