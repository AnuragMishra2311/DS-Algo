Given a binary string, that is it contains only 0s and 1s. We need to make this string a sequence of alternate characters by flipping some of the bits, our goal is to minimize 
the number of bits to be flipped.

Examples:

Input : str = “001”
Output : 1
Minimum number of flips required = 1
We can flip 1st bit from 0 to 1 

Input : str = “0001010111”
Output : 2
Minimum number of flips required = 2
We can flip 2nd bit from 0 to 1 and 9th 
bit from 1 to 0 to make alternate 
string “0101010101”.

    for i in range(len(s)): #Starting with 0
        if i&1:#odd
            if s[i]!='0':
                garbar_for_starting_with_0+=1
        else:
            if s[i]!='1':
                garbar_for_starting_with_0+=1
                
    for i in range(len(s)): #Starting with 1
        if i&1:#odd
            if s[i]!='1':
                garbar_for_starting_with_1+=1
        else:
            if s[i]!='0':
                garbar_for_starting_with_1+=1
                
    print(min(garbar_for_starting_with_0,garbar_for_starting_with_1))
